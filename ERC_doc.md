###############################ERC_IS?############################################

Each standart has its own a set of tools prescribed within the contract. It makes our contract support services (for example https://opensea.io/). It helps services to decrypt unique code inside our contract and do its own logic . For example the first cryptogame supports ERC-721 standart, its name is CryptoKities. For example, the most valuable nft(non-fangible-token) was minted in CryptoKitties. Its price equals 600 ETH!!!
